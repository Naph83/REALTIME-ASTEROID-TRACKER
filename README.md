# REALTIME-ASTEROID-TRACKER
This program takes data from NASA's NEO API and maintains a list of asteroids passing earth in real-time.  The tracker captures asteroid name, diameter, velocity, date/time of closest approach, and distance from Earth. This program also indicates whether or not any asteroid is hazardous to Earth. All source code is written in Python.
